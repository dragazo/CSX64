# CSX64
CSX64 is an educational tool for learning/practicing low-level programming in a well-documented, safe, emulated environment that is platform independent. Aside from the WinForms GUI, CSX64 is entirely self-contained in the CSX64 class, and could be included in another project (e.g. a game in Unity).
